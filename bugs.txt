BUGS
after finishing the interaction,
- when interacting again, i cant progress the dialogue after index 0
- i can clip through the npc
- walking animation isn't enabled
- red's indicator is visible

general
- the throw animation doesnt work at certain intervals
- index out of range (but still works properly)
- exit button isnt working
- cant move after interacting





- how to reduce redudancy in scripts? for example, i had to
  reuse dialogue into dialogue and dialogue_2 and
  reuse scene_switch into scene_switch and scene_switch_2
  but i need to still make slight modifications in individual scripts,
  thats why i need multiple.
